OpenModularGuns
===============
An open source Minecraft gun mod. The goal is to allow users to be tacti _cool_ with 3D gun models, attachments, and more!

Planned Features
----------------

- 3D weapon models
- Attachment system
	- Custom sights
	- Under barrel attachments
		- Flashlights
		- Grenade launchers
	- Different magazine types
		- Certain guns will only support certain ammo types
		- Examples: 100 round drum magazine, 30 round clip, etc...
- Weapon animations
	- Player's hands actually grip the weapon
	- Two states: Aiming down sights and firing from the hip
- Full API allowing modders to add their own weapons easily
	- In the future medsouz would like to make some form of content pack feature so you can add weapons without writing code
- Tacti _cool_ realism

<sup>Note: Just because medsouz wants these features doesn't mean he will be able to implement them all!</sup>
